Homework 6
==========

### Due Friday, October 20, 2017 - 5:00PM

In this homework, you will practice using recursion.

For this assignment, you will implement the methods defined in the class `RecursionFun`. 

:warning: to earn full credit for passing the test cases you may **not** use loops in any part of your solution. 

Some of these methods appear on the [Coding Bat](http://codingbat.com/) website. Note that copying any part of a solution to any of these methods will be considered academic dishonesty!

### Submission Requirements

1. Use the following link to create your private github repository for this assignment. The repository will be seeded with the skeleton code, test cases, and input files. [Homework 6](https://classroom.github.com/a/wsfjwRdM)
2. For full credit, make sure to follow all [Style Guidelines](https://github.com/CS514-F17/notes/blob/master/Admin/style.md). Points will be deducted for each violation.

### Grading Rubric

| Points | Criterion | Description |
| ------ | -------- | -------- |  
| 9 | testCleanString methods | Code passes all test cases and does not use loops. |
| 9 | testChangeXY methods | Code passes all test cases and does not use loops. |
| 9 | testArray11 methods | Code passes all test cases and does not use loops. |
| 9 | testArray6 methods | Code passes all test cases and does not use loops. |
| 9 | testTriangle methods | Code passes all test cases and does not use loops. |
| 5 | Style | Code follows all style guidelines. |

Partial credit may be awarded for partial functionality and/or partially correct style elements.

### Academic Dishonesty

Any work you submit is expected to be your own original work. If you use any web resources in developing your code you are required to cite those resources. The only exception to this rule is code that is posted on the class website. The URL of the resource you used in a comment in your code is fine. If I google even a single line of uncited code and find it on the internet you may get a 0 on the assignment or an F in the class. You may also get a 0 on the assignment or an F in the class if your solution is at all similar to that of any other student.
